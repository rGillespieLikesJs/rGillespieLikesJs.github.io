    <h1> I should have done this sooner</h1>
    <p1> This is my first project using HTML, I am learning HTML this semester to eventually earn my degree in IT-Programming. This is also my first semester of online college; I was originally going to attend last semester but had an opportunity arise which I couldn't refuse. From late June to early July all the way to November, I was the general manager of Papa Murphys in Mattoon...Somehow. <i> Yes I did that at eighteen.</i> </p1>

    <h3> Trying to Live Up to the New Chapter. </h3>
    <p2> Now that the store is closed I have to find another use for my life and time. I got a job stocking produce, which is awful. Since I'm not working full-time, I may as well focus on earning an education. I didn't shift focus very well. I've always been interested in computers and I have built around seven to eight of them, but <b> programming is a whole different challenge.</b> My girlfriend, whom I love, always tells me how smart or intelligent I am, yet I fail to see it. I'm also struggling to find why I procrastinate so much and so often. Sometimes I wish I could see myself the way my family does; I wish I was as smart or motivated as they think I am.
